# DevSecOps principles

1.	Shift Left Security: In DevSecOps, security is "shifted left," meaning it's introduced early in the software development process. Security concerns are addressed during the design and development phases, reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities making their way into the final product.
Example: During the design phase of a new application, security professionals collaborate with developers to identify potential security risks and define security requirements. They might conduct threat modeling sessions to anticipate and address security vulnerabilities before any code is written.

2.	Collaboration: Collaboration is a key principle of DevSecOps. Developers, operations teams, and security professionals work together from the beginning to identify security requirements, conduct threat modeling, and address vulnerabilities.
Example: Developers, operations teams, and security experts participate in cross-functional teams. They hold regular meetings to discuss security requirements, address vulnerabilities, and make informed decisions about the application's security posture.

---

3.	Automation: Automation is central to DevSecOps. Automated security testing, code analysis, and vulnerability scanning are integrated into the development pipeline. This ensures that security checks are consistent, thorough, and repeatable.
Example: Automated security testing tools, like static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) scanners, are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Code is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities at each commit, ensuring that vulnerabilities are caught early and consistently.

---

4.	Continuous Security: Similar to continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), DevSecOps promotes continuous security. Security practices are applied at every stage of the software development lifecycle, and security assessments are conducted frequently.
Example: Automated security checks are run in parallel with every build and deployment. Automated tests for security vulnerabilities are part of the pipeline, providing continuous feedback on the application's security status.

---

5.	Immutable Infrastructure: DevSecOps encourages the use of immutable infrastructure, where systems are created from predefined templates and are not modified in production. This reduces the risk of configuration drift and ensures consistency.
Example: Infrastructure is defined as code using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation. When updates are required, new infrastructure is provisioned from the updated code, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of configuration drift.

---

6.	Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Treating infrastructure as code means defining and provisioning infrastructure using code and automation tools. This allows security configurations to be versioned, tested, and applied consistently.
Example: Instead of manually configuring servers, infrastructure components are defined in code. This code is versioned and stored in a repository. Changes to infrastructure are reviewed, tested, and applied through automation.

---

7.	Threat Modeling: Threat modeling involves assessing the potential threats and vulnerabilities associated with an application. DevSecOps encourages threat modeling early in the development process to address security concerns proactively.
Example: A team conducts a threat modeling exercise for a new microservices-based application. They identify potential attack vectors and security risks associated with each service. Mitigations are implemented before development begins.

---

8.	Container Security: With the rise of containerization, container security becomes crucial. DevSecOps emphasizes securing container images, managing vulnerabilities, and ensuring secure orchestration.
Example: Before deploying containerized applications, security scans are performed on container images. Vulnerabilities are identified and addressed in the images, and only approved images are used in production.

---

9.	Compliance as Code: DevSecOps incorporates compliance requirements into the development process by codifying them as part of the automation. This ensures that applications are built and deployed in alignment with regulatory and organizational standards.
Example: Compliance requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA, are translated into code that defines the necessary security controls. Automated tests verify that these controls are implemented and maintained throughout the development and deployment process.

---

10.	Microservices Security: In microservices architectures, security must be addressed at the individual service level. DevSecOps includes practices to secure each microservice, manage API security, and handle communication securely.
Example: Each microservice is secured individually, with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place. API gateways ensure secure communication between services, and role-based access controls restrict unauthorized access.

---

11.	Education and Training: DevSecOps emphasizes training and awareness across teams. Developers gain security knowledge, and security teams understand development practices, fostering a shared responsibility for security.
Example: Developers undergo security training to learn about common vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and how to use security tools effectively. Security teams gain understanding of the development process and provide guidance on security best practices.

---

12.	Continuous Monitoring and Incident Response: DevSecOps extends beyond development and deployment. Continuous monitoring and incident response mechanisms are established to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.
Example: Real-time monitoring tools continuously collect and analyze application and infrastructure metrics. In case of a security breach, automated alerts are triggered, and incident response plans are executed to mitigate the impact and restore security.
